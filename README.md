# Card Memory Game

Welcome to the Card Memory Game!

This project is a fun and engaging card game built using React and Vite for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.

Starting from a legacy codebase, several exciting features were implemented to make the game more engaging and enjoyable to play.
